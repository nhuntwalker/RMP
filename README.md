# Education in Washington State
## Published: [blog post](http://rationalwhimsy.com/education-in-washington-state-pt-1/)

I look at trends in graduation rates in Washington state between 2007 and 2014. Data is sourced from [the State of Washington Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction](http://www.k12.wa.us/DataAdmin/default.aspx). I first look at the distribution by county, and then look into the distribution by ethnicity. One of the sad realities is that minority populations (black, hispanic, American Indian) are faring FAR worse than the white students, a trend not immediately apparent when looking at the trend amongst all students in total. The (mostly) good news is that these populations are faring better over time, though there appears to be some decline in American Indian graduation rates.

- ***.xlsx**: Raw state and county data from the Office of Superintend of Public Instruction at the state, county, and district levels.

- ***.tsv**: The same files without the headers, and formatted as tab-separated values for use in my script

- **statewide_grad_rate.pdf**: A map of estimated graduation rates across Washington state counties in 2014

- **statewide_dropout_rate.pdf**: A similar map as above, just with dropout rates instead of graduation rates.

- **differential_grad_rate.pdf**: A similar map, with the change in graduation rate between 2007 and 2014

- **differential_dropout_rate.pdf**: A similar map, with the change in dropout rate between 2007 and 2014

- **grad_rate_2007_2014.pdf**: A bar chart of estimated graduation rates between 2007 and 2014 for documented races. Asians and Pacific Islanders are excluded due to differences in reporting their status over this range

- **dropout_rate_2007_2014.pdf**: Same as above, just for dropout rates
